# USB switches to share devices


Requirement: Programmatically switch one device between 4 different computers.
This is required for automated testing of devices via there USB interface.

Professional switches are big, expensive and difficult to evaluate.

So I collected some usb switches which are sold in high volumes.

This evaluation may be helpful for others, so I am publishing it here.
